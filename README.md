# DEEP-LEARNING_ASSIGNMENTS
**ASSIGNMENT-1**

--> In this we have taken the Wine Datatset in which we have performed the MLP Classifier(Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier).

MLP Classifier is a type of Artificial Neural Network(ANN).Simplest MLP consist of at least three layers of nodes:
* An Input Layer
* A Hidden Layer
* An Output Layer

Activation Function in a neural network defines how the weighted sum of the input is transformed into an output from a node or nodes in alayer of network.They are the critical part of the design neural network.
The choice of activation function in the hidden layer will control how well the network model learns the training datasets.
The choice of activation function in the output layer will define the type of predictions the model can make

While training the model, we need to modify each epoch's weights and minimizw the loss function. An optimizer is a function or an algorithm that modifies the attributes of the neural network,such as weights and learning rate.
Thus,it helps in reducing the overall loss and improve the accuracy.

Various optimizers :
8 Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
* Adagrad
* RMSProp
* AdaDelta
* Adam


**ASSIGNMENT-2**
We are simply implementing the mean squared error with and without using numpy.
